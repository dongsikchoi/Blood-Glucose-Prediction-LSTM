# Blood Glucose Level Prediction
- Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by the inability to produce insulin appropriately in the bete cells of the pancreas or to respond appropriately to insulind made by the body's cells

- Thus, this project aims to __predict blood glucose level__ in patients 15, 30 and 60 minutes using the data below.
  - __Internal Factors__ : EGV (Estimated Glucose Value) from __CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) device__, height, weight, underlying disease
  - __External Factors__ : Insulin administration, carbohydrate intake

- Therefore, raw data is pre-processed so that it can be converted into a table of shapes as shown below
